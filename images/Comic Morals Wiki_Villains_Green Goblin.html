               <p>Peter Parker was a timid fifteen-year-old Midtown High School student who was bitten by a radioactive spider, which gave him superhuman spider based-powers and abilities, such as; superhuman strength, speed, agility, leaping, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination and balance, a healing-factor, immunity, the ability to wall-crawl, and sensing/detecting any kind threats and upcoming danger known as "Spider-sense". 
                   He also develops his wrist-mounted high speeding device equipment that resembles spider-webbing on each of his wrists known as "web-shooters" as his main primary weapon, which enables him to web-shoot at his enemies like a web-bullets, and web-swing across the city at high speeds. 
                   Peter originally intended to utilize his newly found abilities to help provide for his Uncle Ben Parker and Aunt May Parker, Peter allowed his fame to get over his head until the death of his Uncle Ben, who was murdered by the thief whom unkbenkownsit to Peter let escape. After his death, Peter vowed to use his spider-powers to fight crime and protect the people of New York City from the evil forces as masked vigilante superhero; Spider-Man, having learned the most valuable lesson "With great power, there must also come great responsibility". 
                   Spider-Man has gained friends and has battled his main enemies such as his arch-enemy, Green Goblin, and then Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Chameleon, Vulture, Mysterio, Electro, Rhino, Shocker, Kingpin, Venom, Carnage, and many more but has also dealt with the ups and downs of life ever since his debut as a superhero.</p>

                    <h2>Motivations:</h2>

                    <p>Upon gaining his powers from getting bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter originally choses to use them for monitary gain by appering in late night live tv shows as a performer, in order to provide his Uncle Ben Parker and Aunt May Parker, casusing all the fame and attention to get over his head. This would ultimately change when Peter had allowed a theif to escape from robbing the studio he was at, inevitably leading to his uncle's murder. Through the guilt of the fact that he could have done something about it and the love for his Uncle Ben, cause him to adopt the qoute "With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility", chosing to now use his powers to protect the streets of New York City and fight crime. For Peter, each time he has saved lives and stoping criminals would be atoning for his mistake of letting his uncle dying, honoring his legacy and hopefully making him proud. Throughout his life, he has allways made the hard choices sacrificing most of his personal and professional life, putting the needs of his lovedones and others before himself while strugling to balance out his life as Peter Parker and Spider-Man.  </p>

Although the Green Goblin is mostly responsible for this event, Spider-Man blames himself, veiwing it as him being reckless while still blaming the Green Goblin.
