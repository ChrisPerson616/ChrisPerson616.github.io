                    <h2>Motivations:</h2>

                    <p> Norman Osborn's primary motivation is simply to acquire mass wealth and power, long before he ever became the Green Goblin. 
                        This is mostly stemmed from his childhood, as an extreme attempt to avoid the failures of his father, who was a strugling business inventor and took out his frustrations and anger out his familiy. 
                        After being exposed to the Goblin Formula, it not only enhanced his physical abilities to superhuman levels, but also caused him to develop a split personality, reprisenting his twisted side. 
                        All of these traits combined, creates a superpowered insane and sadistic mastermind who possess an extreme obsession of power and a drive to eleminiate anyone that he deems a threat to his plans, while expressing joy in tormenting Peter Parker/Spider-Man in anyway he can. </p>
